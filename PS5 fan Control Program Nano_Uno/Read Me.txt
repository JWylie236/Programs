DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS PROJECT IF YOU ARENT VERSED IN ELECTRONICS OR YOUR CONSOLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. THIS 
PROJECT ASSUMES THE USER IS FAMILIAR WITH ELECTRONICS AND IS ONLY MEANT TO GUIDE THEM. I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT OCCUR DUE TO NEGLIGENCE OR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.

You will need the following to build the project.

1x Arduino UNO/Nano.

5x 100k NTC Thermistors (Bulb type).

5x 4.7K Resistors.

1x 170 hole Breadboard.

1x 2004 RepRap Smart controller Liquidcrystal Display.

A selection of jumper wires (preferably Red for 5v power, Black for ground and Yellow for signal wires).

A prefab board may be generated later to eliminate the need for the Breadboard depending on how much 
attention this Project gets.

Instructions_________________________________________________

Each Thermistor must be placed near as possible to its respective Component to get the most accurate 
Temperature readings. 

Do not place the Thermistors in direct contact with any Chip. This isnt necesarry or 
safe as it will interfere with any Heatsinks which are supposed to contact the Chip. Just get as close
as possible to where the Chip is located.

For the main Chip place the Thermistor between the Heatsink fins as close to the center of the main 
Chip as possible.

Place the Thermistors first before doing any wiring. After each Thermistor is placed wrap a piece of 
Tape around the Thermistor wire near the end and write the name of the Chip on
the Tape. This will make it easy to identify which is which easily. example: if the given Thermistor is 
placed over the Memory write "Memory" or a shortform of that on the Tape. Once all the Thermistors have
been placed and labelled you can move onto wiring. 

To figure out where the Memory and Storage chips are you can watch a teardown on 
Youtube of your particular Console. The Teardown Sony did for the original launch model of the Playstation 5 is a good 
example of what you are looking for.

Wiring_____________________________________________________________

To make wiring easier the code has a section at the top explaining which Pin each Thermistor needs to 
go to. You have to follow this order or you will get the right temperatures being displayed in the wrong 
places on the Screen. To wire the Display there is also a description at the top of the code listing 
which Display Pin goes to what Pin on the Arduino. To get the pinout for the Display you can visit 
https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap2004LCD. In addition there is also an schematic detailing the wiring of 
the Thermistors all the way to the Arduino.

To figure out which Pin is the Signal Pin for the Fan You will need to remove the Fan and trace the wires back to the 
fans Circuit Board. You will See "+" sign for the power, a "-" for the Ground and a "S" sign for the Signal Wire. If 
you dont see this take a picture and send it to me and i'll help you figure it out.

To Provide power to the Arduino you can connect to one of the USB ports on the Playstation 5. The only caveat is that 
the Arduino will need a switch or to be unplugged between uses.

Program Description________________________________________________

This Program was developed to give Playstation 5 owners control over the Cooling fan to prevent overheating 
particularily in hotter climates where air-conditioning isnt guaranteed and Sony's hidden and limited fan curve 
profile isnt sufficient. This program is also meant for those who dont like their console acting like a 
space heater or just want to get an idea of how hot the various chips are.

The Program is pre configured to turn the fan on starting at 30% once any chip passes 30c and ramp up with each 
degree maxing the fan out at 75% at 60c and above. The fan curve can be modified at the users discretion if desired 
however the provided configuration should be sufficient for all climates short of the place being on fire.

The downside to running the fan past what Sony limited the Fan to is that it will have a more audible signature and 
dust will accumulate more quickly so more frequent cleaning will be needed.
